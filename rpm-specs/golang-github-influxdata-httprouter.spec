%global common_description %{expand:
HttpRouter is a lightweight high performance HTTP request router (also called
multiplexer or just mux for short) for Go.

In contrast to the default mux of Go's net/http package, this router supports
variables in the routing pattern and matches against the request method. It also
scales better.

The router is optimized for high performance and a small memory footprint. It
scales well even with very long paths and a large number of routes. A
compressing dynamic trie (radix tree) structure is used for efficient matching.}
