%global common_description %{expand:
Package dkim is a pure Go DKIM verification library.

The main use-case for the dkim package is verifying DKIM "ownership proofs" of
e-mail addresses. The owner of an e-mail address can sent DKIM-signed e-mails,
and anyone in the world can verify that those e-mail were sent by the owner by
checking the DKIM signature. The dkim package exposes an API to verify DKIM
signatures, and to inspect the signed headers of the e-mail.

As an added feature, the dkim package supports extracting and verifying just the
signed headers of an e-mail. This makes ownership proofs much shorter.}
