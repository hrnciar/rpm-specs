%global common_description %{expand:
Chi is a lightweight, idiomatic and composable router for building Go HTTP
services. It's especially good at helping you write large REST API services that
are kept maintainable as your project grows and changes. chi is built on the new
context package introduced in Go 1.7 to handle signaling, cancelation and
request-scoped values across a handler chain.

The focus of the project has been to seek out an elegant and comfortable design
for writing REST API servers, written during the development of the Pressly API
service that powers our public API service, which in turn powers all of our
client-side applications.}
