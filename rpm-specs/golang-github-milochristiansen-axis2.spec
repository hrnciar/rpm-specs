%global common_description %{expand:
AXIS is based on a few simple interfaces and a set of API functions that operate
on these interfaces. Clients use the provided implementations of these
interfaces (or provide their own custom implementations) to create "data
sources" that may be mounted on a "file system" and used for OS-independent file
IO.

AXIS was originally written to allow files inside of archives to be handled with
exactly the same API as used for files inside of directories, but it has since
grown to allow "logical" files and directories as well as "multiplexing"
multiple items on the same location (to, for example, make two directories look
and act like one). These properties make AXIS perfect for handling data and
configuration files for any program where flexibility is important, the program
does not need to know where its files are actually located, it simply needs them
to be at a certain place in it's AXIS file system. Changing where a program
loads it's files from is then as simple as changing the code that initializes
the file system.}
