%global common_description %{expand:
Consul is a tool for service discovery and configuration. Consul is distributed,
highly available, and extremely scalable.

Consul provides several key features:
 - Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register
   themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface.
   External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.
 - Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators
   about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery
   prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level circuit
   breakers.
 - Key/Value Storage - A flexible key/value store enables storing dynamic
   configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election and more. The
   simple HTTP API makes it easy to use anywhere.
 - Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support
   any number of regions without complex configuration.
 - Service Segmentation - Consul Connect enables secure service-to-service
   communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based
   authorization.}
