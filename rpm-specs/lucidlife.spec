%description
LucidLife is a Conway's Life simulator. The rules are rather simple. The game
is started with a large grid of cell locations, and an arbitrary set of
living cells. On each turn, each cell thrives or dies based on the number of 
cells which surround it. A dead (empty) cell with three live cells around it
becomes a living cell (a birth); a living cell with two or three neighbors
survives; otherwise the cell dies (due to overcrowding) or remains dead
(due to loneliness). It is based on the the GtkLife project, but with a
more modern user interface and other enhancements.
