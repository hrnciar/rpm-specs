%description
EQP is an automated theorem proving program for first-order equational
logic. Its strengths are good implementations of associative-commutative
unification and matching, a variety of strategies for equational
reasoning, and fast search. It seems to perform well on many
problems about lattice-like structures.

EQP is not a stable and polished production theorem prover like Otter
or Prover9. Since it has obtained several interesting results, it was
decided to make it available (including the source code) to everyone, with
no restrictions (and of course no warranty either). EQP's documentation
is not great, but if you already know Otter, you probably will not have
great difficulty in learning to use EQP.

In the early 1930's, it was postulated that every Robbin's Algebra,
(named after Herbert Ellis Robbins), must also be a Boolean Algebra. Many
human mathematicians attempted to find a proof, or a counter-example
of this conjecture, but failed. The EQP automated theorem prover
(and its author William McCune) made history by providing the first
known proof in 1996. The EQP input files for proving Robbin's
Conjecture can be found in the package documentation directory
