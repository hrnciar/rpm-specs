Name:           prusa-slicer
Version:        2.2.0
Release:        6%{?dist}
Summary:        3D printing slicer optimized for Prusa printers

# The main PrusaSlicer code and resources are AGPLv3, with small parts as
# Boost.  but it includes some bundled libraries under varying licenses which
# are statically linked into the main executable.  The full list would be:
# "AGPLv3 and CC-BY and GPLv2+ and (Copyright only or BSD) and Boost and
# MPLv2.0 and MIT and Unlicense and zlib and Qhull" (with Unlicense removed in
# F31) but the AGPLv3 dominates in the final executable.
# Technically the appdata.xml file is 0BSD but it seems quite pointless to list
# that here.

%description
PrusaSlicer takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code
instructions for FFF printers or PNG layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's
compatible with any modern printer based on the RepRap toolchain, including all
those based on the Marlin, Prusa, Sprinter and Repetier firmware. It also works
with Mach3, LinuxCNC and Machinekit controllers.

PrusaSlicer is based on Slic3r by Alessandro Ranelucci and the RepRap
community.
