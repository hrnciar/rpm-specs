%global common_description %{expand:
A metric system for high performance counters and histograms. Unlike popular
metric systems today, this does not destroy the accuracy of histograms by
sampling. Instead, a logarithmic bucketing function compresses values, generally
within 1% of their true value (although between 0 and 1 the precision loss may
not be within this boundary). This allows for extreme compression, which allows
us to calculate arbitrarily high percentiles with no loss of accuracy - just a
small amount of precision. This is particularly useful for highly-clustered
events that are tolerant of a small precision loss, but for which you REALLY
care about what the tail looks like, such as measuring latency across a
distributed system.

Copied out of my work for the CockroachDB metrics system. Based on an algorithm
created by Keith Frost.}
