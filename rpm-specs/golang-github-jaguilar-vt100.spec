%global common_description %{expand:
Package Vt100 implements a quick-and-dirty programmable ANSI terminal emulator.

You could, for example, use it to run a program like nethack that expects a
terminal as a subprocess. It tracks the position of the cursor, colors, and
various other aspects of the terminal's state, and allows you to inspect them.

We do very much mean the dirty part. It's not that we think it might have bugs.
It's that we're SURE it does. Currently, we only handle raw mode, with no cooked
mode features like scrolling. We also misinterpret some of the control codes,
which may or may not matter for your purpose.}
