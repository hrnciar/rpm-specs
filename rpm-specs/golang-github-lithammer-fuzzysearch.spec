%global common_description %{expand:
Inspired by bevacqua/fuzzysearch, a fuzzy matching library written in
JavaScript. But contains some extras like ranking using Levenshtein distance
(see RankMatch()) and finding matches in a list of words (see Find()).

Fuzzy searching allows for flexibly matching a string with partial input,
useful for filtering data very quickly based on lightweight user input.

The current implementation uses the algorithm suggested by Mr. Aleph, a russian
compiler engineer working at V8.}
