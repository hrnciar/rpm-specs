%global common_description %{expand:
The concept is simple, describe valid uses of your library as states and
actions. States describe which actions are possible, and with what probability
they should occur. Actions mutate the context and transition to another state.

By doing this, two things are possible:
 - Use go-fuzz to find/test interesting sequences of operations on your library.
 - Automate longevity testing of your application by performing long sequences
   of valid operations.

Both of these can also incorporate validation logic (not just failure detection
by building validation into the state machine).}
