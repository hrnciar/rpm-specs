%description
SASS brings countless amazing features to CSS. Besides being used in web 
development, CSS is also the way to stylize Qt-based desktop applications. 
However, Qt's CSS has a few variations that prevent the direct use of 
SASS compiler. The purpose of this tool is to fill the gap between SASS 
and Qt-CSS by handling those variations.
