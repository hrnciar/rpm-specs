#		The yuicompressor uses the javascript parser from rhino.
#		However, it calls private functions not exported by the
#		rhino jar, so it can not use the jar provided by the
#		distribution. The upstream source unjars a bundled copy of
#		the rhino jar and builds using its precompiled class files.
#		This violates the no precompiled sources guidelines. Only
#		part of the rhino source tree is used by yuicompressor. The
#		upstream sources also contains modified versions of a few
#		of the rhino sources. These changes are restored by patch 0.
#		Source 1 is a slimmed down version of the rhino sources of
#		the same version that is bundled in the upstream sources.
#		Source 2 is the	script used to create Source 1.

%description
The YUI Compressor is a JavaScript compressor which, in addition to
removing comments and white-spaces, obfuscates local variables using
the smallest possible variable name. This obfuscation is safe, even
when using constructs such as 'eval' or 'with' (although the
compression is not optimal in those cases) Compared to jsmin, the
average savings is around 20%.

The YUI Compressor is also able to safely compress CSS files. The
decision on which compressor is being used is made on the file
extension (js or css).
