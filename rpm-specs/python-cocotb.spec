# NOTE: the only library that we can't build in Fedora
# is the FLI interface to modelsim. See:
# https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb/blob/master/cocotb_build_libs.py#L339
# One way to work around that would be to ship the cocotb_build_libs.py
# script and install it system-wide. I have't decided if that makes sense.
# But I believe that this package will actually still work with modelsim
# through VPI; so ultimately I don't think there's a huge reduction in
# functionality. Still, I wanted to write this down somewhere.

Provides:       cocotb = %{version}-%{release}

# It isn't *strictly* necessary to have iverilog/ghdl installed, especially
# since cocotb also supports non-FOSS simulators. Thus, use a weak dep to
# pull them in (but allow someone to remove them if necessary).
