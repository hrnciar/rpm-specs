%description
The Readline library provides a set of functions that allow users to
edit command lines. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The
Readline library includes additional functions for maintaining a list
of previously-entered command lines for recalling or editing those
lines, and for performing csh-like history expansion on previous
commands.

This is a port of the library and development tools to Windows.
