%global common_description %{expand:
Systemstat allows you to add system statistics to your go program; it currently
polls the linux kernel for CPU usage, free/used memory and swap sizes, and
uptime for your go process, as well as the system you're running it on, and the
system load. It can be used to make a crippled version of top that monitors the
current go process and ignores other processes and the number of users with
ttys. See the examples directory for go-top.go, which is my attempt at a top
clone. Bear in mind that the intention of systemstat is to allow your process to
monitor itself and it's environment, not to replace top.}
