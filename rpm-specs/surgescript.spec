%description
SurgeScript is a scripting language for games. It has been designed
with the specific needs of games in mind. Its features include:
- The state-machine pattern: objects are state machines,
  making it easy to create in-game entities
- The composition approach: you may design complex objects
  and behaviors by means of composition
- The hierarchy system: objects have a parent and may have children,
  in a tree-like structure
- The game loop: it's defined implicitly
- Automatic garbage collection, object tagging and more!

SurgeScript is meant to be used in games and in interactive applications.
It's easy to integrate it into existing code, it's easy to extend,
it features a C-like syntax, and it's free and open-source software.

SurgeScript has been designed based on the experience of its developer
dealing with game engines, applications related to computer graphics and so on.
Some of the best practices have been incorporated into the language itself,
making things really easy for developers and modders.
