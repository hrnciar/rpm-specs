%global common_description %{expand:
Go-glob is a single-function library implementing basic string glob support.

Globs are an extremely user-friendly way of supporting string matching without
requiring knowledge of regular expressions or Go's particular regex engine. Most
people understand that if you put a * character somewhere in a string, it is
treated as a wildcard. Surprisingly, this functionality isn't found in Go's
standard library, except for path.Match, which is intended to be used while
comparing paths (not arbitrary strings), and contains specialized logic for this
use case. A better solution might be a POSIX basic (non-ERE) regular expression
engine for Go, which doesn't exist currently.}
