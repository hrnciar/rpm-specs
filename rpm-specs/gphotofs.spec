%description
A filesystem client based on libgphoto2 that exposes supported cameras
as filesystems; while some cameras implement the USB Mass Storage class
and already appear as filesystems (making this program redundant), many
use the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) or some other custom protocol.
But as long as the camera is supported by libgphoto2, it can be mounted
as a filesystem using this program.
