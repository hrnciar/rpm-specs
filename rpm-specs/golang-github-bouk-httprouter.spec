%global common_description %{expand:
HttpRouter is a lightweight high performance HTTP request router (also called
multiplexer or just mux for short) for Go.

In contrast to the [default mux][http.ServeMux] of Go's net/http package, this
router supports variables in the routing pattern and matches against the request
method. It also scales better.

The router is optimized for high performance and a small memory footprint. It
scales well even with very long paths and a large number of routes. A
compressing dynamic trie (radix tree) structure is used for efficient
matching.}
