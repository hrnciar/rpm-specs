# While mp3fs does encode to MP3, it is a consumer, not a provider
#Provides: mp3encoder
# While mp3fs does not strictly require the fuse cli (which does not provide
# the fuse libraries), mp3fs is fairly useless without it.

%description
MP3FS is A read-only FUSE file-system which trans-codes audio formats (currently
FLAC) to MP3 on the fly when opened and read. This was written to enable me to
use my FLAC collection with software and/or hardware which only understands
MP3. e.g. "GMediaServer" to a Netgear MP101 mp3 player.

It is also a novel alternative to traditional mp3 encoder applications. Just
use your favorite file browser to select the files you want encoded and copy
them somewhere!
