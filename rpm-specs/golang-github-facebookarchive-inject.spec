%global common_description %{expand:
Package inject provides a reflect based injector. A large application built with
dependency injection in mind will typically involve the boring work of setting
up the object graph. This library attempts to take care of this boring work by
creating and connecting the various objects. Its use involves you seeding the
object graph with some (possibly incomplete) objects, where the underlying types
have been tagged for injection. Given this, the library will populate the
objects creating new ones as necessary. It uses singletons by default, supports
optional private instances as well as named instances.

It works using Go's reflection package and is inherently limited in what it can
do as opposed to a code-gen system with respect to private fields.}
