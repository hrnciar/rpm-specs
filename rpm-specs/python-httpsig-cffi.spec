%description
Sign HTTP requests with secure signatures according to the IETF HTTP
Signatures specification (Draft 3_). This is a fork of the fork of the
original module that was made to fully support both RSA and HMAC
schemes as well as unit test both schemes to prove they work. This
particular fork moves from PyCrypto to Cryptography, which provides
PyPy support.
