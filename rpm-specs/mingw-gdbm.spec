# Prevent gdbm from storing uninitialized memory content
# to database files.
# The change allows Valgrind users to debug their packages without
# dealing with gdbm-related noise. It also improves security, as
# the uninitialized memory might contain sensitive informations
# from other applications. The patch is taken from Debian.

%description
Gdbm is a GNU database indexing library, including routines which use
extensible hashing.  Gdbm works in a similar way to standard UNIX dbm
routines.  Gdbm is useful for developers who write C applications and
need access to a simple and efficient database or who are building C
applications which will use such a database.

This is the MinGW Windows port of the libraries and development tools.
