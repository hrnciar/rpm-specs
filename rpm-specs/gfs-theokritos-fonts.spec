%global fontdescription   %{expand:
Yannis Kefallinos (1894‚Äì1958) was one of the most innovative engravers of his
generation and the first who researched methodically the aesthetics of book and
typographic design in Greece. He taught at the Fine Arts School of Athens and
established the first book design workshop from which many practicing artists
of the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs had graduated.

In the late 50‚Äôs Kefallinos designed and published an exquisite book with
engraved illustrations of the ancient white funerary pottery in Attica in
collaboration with Varlamos, Montesanto, Damianakis. For the text of
Kefallinos‚Äô ŒîŒ≠Œ∫Œ± ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫Œ±ŒØ ŒªŒÆŒ∫œÖŒ∏ŒøŒπ (1956) the artist used a typeface which he
himself had designed a few years before for an unrealized edition of
Theocritos‚Äô Idyls. Its complex and heavily decorative design does point to
aesthetic codes which preoccupied his artistic expression and, although
impractical for contemporary text setting, it remains an original display
face, or it can be used as initials.

The book design workshop of the Fine Arts School of Athens has been recently
reorganized, under the direction of professor Leoni Vidali, and with her
collaboration George D. Matthiopoulos has redesigned digitally this historical
font which is now available as GFS Theokritos.}
