# Rationale for choosing a post release:
#
# The version that I use from git is a couple commits *after* 0.3.0 and there
# is no more recent tag in the upstream repository. Previously I have used
# xss-lock 0.3.0 on Ubuntu 15.04 and had a bug with it, it would not exit when
# I logged out of the graphics session. Then it would hammer one CPU core. The
# repository contains commits which suggest that this bug has been addressed
# but not yet released.

%description
*xss-lock* hooks up your favorite locker to the MIT screen saver extension for
X and also to systemd's login manager. The locker is executed in response to
events from these two sources:

- X signals when screen saver activation is forced or after a period of user
  inactivity (as set with `xset s TIMEOUT`). In the latter case, the notifier
  command, if specified, is executed first.

- The login manager can also request that the session be locked; as a result of
  `loginctl lock-sessions`, for example. Additionally, **xss-lock** uses the
  inhibition logic to lock the screen before the system goes to sleep.

*xss-lock* waits for the locker to exit -- or kills it when screen saver
deactivation or session unlocking is forced -- so the command should not fork.

Also, *xss-lock* manages the idle hint on the login session. The idle state of
the session is directly linked to user activity as reported by X (except when
the notifier runs before locking the screen). When all sessions are idle, the
login manager can take action (such as suspending the system) after a
preconfigured delay.
